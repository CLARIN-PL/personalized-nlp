"""Run personalized & standard AL experiments.

This package should be decoupled from the rest of project as much as possible.
Dependencies `personalized_active_learning` -> `rest_of_code` are ok. whereas opposite
are not. The aim here is to be able to merge with main branch without problems
or extract code to separated repo without problems.
